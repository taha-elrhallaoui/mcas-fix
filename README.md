## ICAO Labels
A userscript for the unlucky users of https://crew.royalairmaroc.com/. Adds labels when you mouse over the *IATA*<sup><sup>why?!</sup></sup> airport codes, that way you don't have to Google where you're going to be tomorrow...

Needs [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) to work.
